# Machine Learning with Python: A Learning Path ü§ñüìà

Welcome to the **Machine Learning with Python** learning path! This repository provides a structured approach to mastering core machine learning concepts using Python. It includes workshops that combine theory with hands-on practice to help you build a strong foundation.

---

## üî• Workshops Series Overview

This learning path is divided into the following key workshops:

1. **Supervised Learning - KNN**  
   Learn about the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, how it works, and its applications in classification and regression.  

2. **Supervised Learning - Linear Regression**  
   Understand linear regression, a fundamental algorithm for predictive modeling, and how to implement it in Python.  

3. **Unsupervised Learning - K-means**  
   Explore clustering with K-means and learn how to uncover patterns in unlabeled datasets.
